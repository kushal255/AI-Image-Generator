# AI Image Generator

## What it does
This web application allows users to generate stunning AI-powered images from text descriptions using the Pollinations API. Users can customize the art style, resolution, image quality, and the number of images generated.

## Features
- Text prompt input to describe the desired image
- Selectable art styles such as realistic, cartoon, cyberpunk, and more
- Resolution and quality options for generated images
- Multiple image generation at once (1, 2, or 4 images)
- Download generated images directly
- View images in a full-screen modal popup
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for content structure
- CSS3 (in external `style.css`) for styling and responsive design
- JavaScript (in external `script.js`) for DOM manipulation, event handling, and API interaction
- Pollinations AI API for image generation via URL parameters

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser with internet access.
3. Enter your image description, select options, and click **Generate Images** to see AI-generated results.

## Special Instructions or Notes
- The app runs fully client-side and depends on the Pollinations AI API, so an internet connection is required.
- Image generation is simulated by dynamically constructing image URLs; actual AI image generation depends on Pollinations API availability.
- For best performance, use a modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
